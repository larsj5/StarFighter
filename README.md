## Overview

I created a game with c++, GLUT, and OpenGL, and it's called StarFighter. It's modeled after the arcade game "Galaxy Shooter", where you are a ship and you have to try and shoot and kill enemy ships that are approaching. In my game, you are the white block, and the enemies are the red and orange blocks. Red blocks move slow and predictably, but if they get past you they come back with another extra red ship. Orange ships move up and down and are faster, but don't add another enemy if they make it past you. You have a finite amount of ammo to use to kill the ships, so making sure to pickup as many green ammo boxes as you can is essential to winning. If you completely overlap with an enemy ship you die, so watch out for that. 

Use the arrow keys to move the ship and the space bar to shoot. Your goal is to kill all the enemy ships, or at least as many as you can. In the start screen, you have to press the start button to begin.
